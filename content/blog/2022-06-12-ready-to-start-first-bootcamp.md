Tomorrow morning, 13 students will walk in the doors of the Willston
Multicultural Center to learn web development, hear from an amazing array of 9
or so guest speakers, and have the opportunity to take home a laptop. Thank you
to all of the people who are making this possible. We have raised over $5,000
and have received 10 laptops with an estimated value of ~$3,000. Wow! I simply
do not have words to express how grateful I am for the generosity shown to
(hopefully) make this project a success. Thank you to [Comunidad]; without our
partnership, we would not have a physical space for the bootcamp, students, or
the ability to receive donations. [Restoration Anglican Church] has shown up in
ways I never could have imagined. They have provided tremendous support in
getting the word out about Willston Web. Most of our laptops monetary
contributions, and speakers have come through members of Restoration. I could
not ask to be a part of a better church.

Below is a photo of the 13 computers physically cleaned, digitally wiped, and
ready for a new owner! We purchased a couple of additional laptops (with one
arriving today) since we ended up having more students than we anticipated (a
good thing!).

I'll periodically be posting updates on the status of the bootcamp, so make sure
you're subscribed! Feel free to share this with anyone who might also want to
hear about how the bootcamp is going. We are excited to meet our students!
