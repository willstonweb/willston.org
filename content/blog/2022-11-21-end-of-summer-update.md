Here is a long overdue update on what happened after the bootcamp. Thank you so much to everyone who helped make this happen!

- All twelve students completed the curriculum taught during the week-long bootcamp, got to keep their laptops, and went to Busch Gardens
- Students were extremely engaged: one parent said, "they can't stop talking about it at home..."
- Five students completed [freeCodeCamp\'s (New) Responsive Web Design Certificate](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design) (estimated 300 hours of work)
	- Three of them received a brand new MacBook Air
- All students received [cash prizes](https://willston.org/curriculum/glossary/#prizes) (at least $300)
- One student helped another, who hadn't participated in the bootcamp, complete [Willston Web\'s curriculum](https://willston.org/curriculum)
- One student created a [public-facing website](https://brandoniscoding381.github.io/portfolio/)
