success! Thank you to Ms. Maralee, Patrick, Rebecca, Ricardo, and my mom for
arriving early to help set up. All 13 students we were expecting showed up and
were very interested in learning. They stayed on task and were productive with
their time. Many of them are eager to continue working and wanted to bring their
laptops home so they could keep going through curriculum. The prospect of a
premium laptop is quite the motivator! One student has limited English
proficiency, but was still able to follow along with brief explanations in
Spanish when needed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Students learned how to use a new operating system (&lt;a href="https://pop.system76.com" target="_blank">Pop!_OS&lt;/a>), laid out HTML
document structure with paper, and completed at least steps 1-6 of
&lt;a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp&amp;#39;s (New) Responsive Web Design Certificate&lt;/a>, where they learned
about header and paragraph tags, comments, SEO (search engine optimization), and
indentation. Here is a &lt;a href="/curriculum/bootcamp/1">link to today&amp;#39;s lesson plan&lt;/a> and below are photos from
our first day:&lt;/p>

Multicultural Center to learn web development, hear from an amazing array of 9
or so guest speakers, and have the opportunity to take home a laptop. Thank you
to all of the people who are making this possible. We have raised over $5,000
and have received 10 laptops with an estimated value of ~$3,000. Wow! I simply
do not have words to express how grateful I am for the generosity shown to
(hopefully) make this project a success. Thank you to &lt;a href="https://comunidadva.org" target="_blank">Comunidad&lt;/a>; without our
partnership, we would not have a physical space for the bootcamp, students, or
the ability to receive donations. &lt;a href="https://restorationarlington.org" target="_blank">Restoration Anglican Church&lt;/a> has shown up in
ways I never could have imagined. They have provided tremendous support in
getting the word out about Willston Web. Most of our laptops, monetary
contributions, and speakers have come through members of Restoration. I could
not ask to be a part of a better church.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Below is a photo of the 13 computers physically cleaned, digitally wiped, and
ready for a new owner! We purchased a couple of additional laptops (with one
arriving today) since we ended up having more students than we anticipated (a
good thing!).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ll periodically be posting updates on the status of the bootcamp, so make sure
you&amp;rsquo;re subscribed! Feel free to share this with anyone who might also want to
hear about how the bootcamp is going. We are excited to meet our students!&lt;/p></description><link>/ready-to-start-first-bootcamp/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/ready-to-start-first-bootcamp/</guid></item><item><title>The Lenovo IdeaPad 1</title><description>&lt;p>Over the past number of years, Chromebooks have become quite popular, with &lt;a href="https://www.blog.google/outreach-initiatives/education/2020-chromebooks/" target="_blank">40
million currently used in education&lt;/a>. The three main reasons people use
Chromebooks are cost, simplicity, and it&amp;rsquo;s provided by their school. These are
all valid reasons for using a Chromebook, but I would like to break each one
down and provide an example of a comparable laptop that isn&amp;rsquo;t a Chromebook and
can better serve as a phenomenal device for someone looking to get into
programming.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="cost">Cost&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This reason why people purchase Chromebooks makes a lot of sense. They are a lot
cheaper than many other laptops available. For the vast majority of people, cost
determines is the most important factor when purchasing a computing device.
Google did a great job lowering the barrier to entry to computers. A decent
Chromebook can now be purchased for ~$100-250. Chrome OS can run on devices that
would have a hard time running Windows or cannot even run Windows because they
have an ARM processor. While ARM processors are really efficient, adoption has
not gotten nearly as close to that of x86_64 processors yet, so there is still a
lot of software that works well on on x86_64 processors, but not on ARM.
Luckily, there are x86_64 laptops that are in the same price range as
Chromebooks (hint: the Lenovo IdeaPad 1).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="simplicity">Simplicity&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Chrome OS is essentially a glorified web browser with the ability to save a few
files to the hard drive&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, which isn&amp;rsquo;t necessarily a bad thing. This is all
some people —if you just require the ability to check email and visit a few
websites in an operating system, you don&amp;rsquo;t need anything more than Chrome OS;
however, programmers need a little more freedom with their operating system that
what Chrome OS provides. For users that are not so technically savvy, a
Chromebook that comes with Chrome OS pre-installed is really the only option as
Linux is still too difficult for the average person to install, but I urge those
who would like to get into programming to take the time to learn how to flash a
Linux distribution to USB stick and install a Linux themselves&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. The &lt;a href="https://getfedora.org/en/workstation/download/" target="_blank">Fedora
Media Writer&lt;/a> makes this super simple, but it&amp;rsquo;s not much more difficult to
download the &lt;a href="https://linuxmint.com/" target="_blank">Linux Mint&lt;/a>, &lt;a href="https://ubuntu.com/desktop" target="_blank">Ubuntu&lt;/a>, or any other Linux distribution&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code>.iso&lt;/code>
and flash the USB stick yourself using a tool like &lt;a href="https://balenaetcher.net/" target="_blank">Balena Etcher&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="school">School&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>With strong Google Workspace integration, it is no surprise that many schools
opt for Chromebooks when providing laptops for students. When you are given a
computer from school, there is not much you can do, but be grateful that your
school system provided you with a laptop at all. Chromebooks, Chrome OS, and
Google Workspace are phenomenal for collaborating with others, turning in
assignments, and making presentations, but are not so optimized for programming.
If schools want to make it easy for their students to write real code, I urge
them to consider laptops and operating systems that are conducive to programming
(meaning you don&amp;rsquo;t have to jump through hoops to get a development environment
working). I understand that this isn&amp;rsquo;t always possible because schools have to
keep security top of mind and can&amp;rsquo;t really have students installing whatever
software they please. Unfortunately, this means that students with their own
personal computers are able to set up a development environment and start
programming, but those who are dependent on the school for computer access are
limited by the tools their school provides&lt;sup id="fnref:3">&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. There are no winners in this
situation.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-ideapad-1">The IdeaPad 1&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We were fortunate to receive the generous donation of two brand new &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Lenovo-IdeaPad-Processor-Graphics-81VU00D1US/dp/B09BG85LRV" target="_blank">14-inch
Lenovo IdeaPad 1 laptops&lt;/a>, which at time of writing, cost ~$245. These laptops
come with Windows installed, so if you are a Windows user, this is a great
Chromebook-priced Windows machine. For others, this laptop could be your entry
to Linux and programming. Linux works great on the IdeaPad 1–all necessary
drivers are in the Linux kernel, so everything including WiFi and the webcam
work out-of-the-box and it has a x86_64 processor, so virtually all Linux
software works on this machine. The two main downsides of this laptop are that
there are no USB-C ports and there is limited storage (64GB), but the storage is
comparable to Chromebooks and could be expanded with the MicroSD card slot. The
keyboard is one of the best I&amp;rsquo;ve used on a laptop and running GNOME 42 in Fedora
36 feels extremely snappy. There is very little to complain about.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My reason for writing this isn&amp;rsquo;t to say that Chromebooks are bad or shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be
purchased, but that there are arguably better options for people looking to
program on their new device. The Lenovo IdeaPad 1 is not the only one of its
kind either—it&amp;rsquo;s just an option. Do your own research before purchasing a new
laptop. I am really happy with this one and am excited to see what our students
think of these new machines!&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes">

&lt;p>Technically, most Chromebooks have eMMC, but &amp;ldquo;hard drive&amp;rdquo; gets the point

&lt;p>Yes, I know you can &lt;a href="https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/chromium-os/chrome-os-systems-supporting-linux" target="_blank">install Linux on select Chromebooks&lt;/a>,
if you&amp;rsquo;re going to install Linux inside of Chrome OS, why not just install Linux
on the entire operating system. It&amp;rsquo;s less of a headache and if you purchase a
device with x86_64 architecture, you won&amp;rsquo;t run into software compatibility with
ARM-based systems.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

Not every student that used a school computer had the same errors and it was
difficult to figure out what happened because the Windows Command Prompt was
blocked from opening.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:3" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

transition from Windows to Linux a little easier. They are pretty simple: adding
a couple of additional buttons to the window titlebar and combining the
application launcher and system tray to make the taskbar more similar to that
found in Windows. Below are screenshots of before and after the tweaks. Look
carefully for the aforementioned changes:&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>

&lt;figcaption>After changes. Notice the additional buttons in the titlebar and
the addition of a Windows-like taskbar.&lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>As you can see, the changes are subtle, but can make a Windows user feel a lot
more at home using the GNOME desktop environment. Here are the steps to
replicate these changes on Fedora:&lt;/p>
