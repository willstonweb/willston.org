<small>by Jonathan Buchholz on <b>June 13, 2022</b></small></h1></header><article><p>Today was the first day of the Willston Web Coding Bootcamp and it was a great
success! Thank you to Ms. Maralee, Patrick, Rebecca, Ricardo, and my mom for
showing up early to help set up. All 13 students we were expecting showed up and
were very interested in learning. They stayed on task and were productive with
their time. Many of them are eager to continue working and wanted to take their
laptops home today so they could keep going through curriculum. The prospect of
a premium laptop is quite the motivator! One student has limited English
proficiency, but was still able to follow along with brief explanations in
Spanish when needed.</p><p>Students learned how to use a new operating system (<a href=https://pop.system76.com target=_blank>Pop!_OS</a>), created HTML
document structure out of paper, and completed steps 1-6 at a minimum of
<a href=https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/ target=_blank>freeCodeCamp's (New) Responsive Web Design Certificate</a>, where they learned
about header and paragraph tags, comments, SEO (search engine optimization), and
indentation. Here is a <a href=/curriculum/bootcamp/1>link to today's lesson plan</a>. Below are photos from our
first day:</p><figure><img src=/images/2022-06-13-1.jpg alt="Wilson looks to the board for instruction"><figcaption>Wilson looks to the board for instruction</figcaption></figure><figure><img src=/images/2022-06-13-2.jpg alt="Janet points out something to Juan"><figcaption>Janet points out something to Juan</figcaption></figure><figure><img src=/images/2022-06-13-3.jpg alt="Juan explains a concept to Janet"><figcaption>Juan explains a concept to Janet</figcaption><figure><img src=/images/2022-06-13-4.jpg alt="Jonathan (student) works with Patrick"><figcaption>Patrick works with Jonathan (student), who is next to Mark</figcaption></figure><figure><img src=/images/2022-06-13-5.jpg alt="The team pauses for a picture after setting up for the day"><figcaption>The team pauses for a picture after setting up for the day</figcaption></figure></article><form action=https://buttondown.email/api/emails/embed-subscribe/willstonweb method=post class=buttondown><label for=bd-email>Subscribe by email!</label><p>Don't worry—just updates.
