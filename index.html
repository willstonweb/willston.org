Jonathan had been wondering how he could make web development more accessible and share skills he had developed at his science and technology focused high school, so he was elated to hear Ricardo desired to learn web development and thought that there might be others like him. Together, they are planning the Willston Web bootcamp. Along with increasing access to personal computers and inspiring students to pursue a career in programming, they want to foster a <i>web</i> of students that learn together in a community effort.</p></section><hr><section id=sign-up><header><h2>Sign up</h2><p>Join our mailing list for program updates:</p></header><form action=https://buttondown.email/api/emails/embed-subscribe/willstonweb method=post target=popupwindow onsubmit='window.open("https://buttondown.email/willstonweb","popupwindow")' class=embeddable-buttondown-form><label for=bd-email>Your email:</label>
