<small>by Jonathan Buchholz on <b>June 17, 2022</b></small></h1></header><article><p>Today was the final day of Willston Web Coding Bootcamp as part of <a href=https://www.comunidadva.org target=_blank>Comunidad</a>&rsquo;s
Rising Leaders Program. 12 students made significant progress on
<a href=https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/ target=_blank>freeCodeCamp's (New) Responsive Web Design Course</a> through the week and took
home donated laptops today to continue working over the summer. Students are
incentivized to keep working, with prizes waiting for them upon completion of
major milestones. One student even stayed up until 2am this morning to keep
working!</p><figure><img src=/images/2022-06-17-1.jpg alt="Bag of Hi-Chew next to Hershey's

Here are a few takeaways from the lunchtime speakers:</p><ul><li>Rebecca and Patrick of Comunidad kicked us off on Monday, and shared their
experiences in the tech industry. Rebecca learned web design over lockdown and
Patrick studied computer science in college and will be teaching CS at Gonzaga
College High School this fall.</li><li>Chris impressed upon us that &ldquo;character counts&rdquo; (pun intended?) and led
everyone through an example where he used Python web scraping to solve a real
life need. (I&rsquo;ll be using what I learned from him to build a tool for students
to compare their progress with each other this summer.)</li><li>Aidan, Ms. Maralee&rsquo;s nephew, shared from the heart, making sure students
understood that it was ok and normal to struggle at times. He emphasized the
importance of perseverance and also provided practical college and career
advice.</li><li>Dani, Jordi, Josie, Julia, and Tomi, came from MasterCard and seem to have
found a great work-life balance. We learned that internships during college
can really prepare you well for future employment.</li><li>Albert, Ian, Katie came from <a href=https://www.brazen.com target=_blank>Brazen</a> to share about jobs in information
technology and security. We also learned that a college degree isn&rsquo;t always
necessary to find a job in the IT field, since certificates can vouch for your
competency.</li></ul><p>Ricardo did an amazing job introducing speakers throughout the week and leading
the panel today!</p><p>This week was a huge win for everyone involved! We will provide an update later
in August when the program comes to and end. Thank you for believing in Willston
