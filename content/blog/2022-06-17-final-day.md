Today was the final day of Willston Web Coding Bootcamp as part of [Comunidad]'s
Rising Leaders Program. 12 students made significant progress on
[freeCodeCamp\'s (New) Responsive Web Design Course] throughout the week and
took home donated laptops today to continue working over the summer. Students
are incentivized to keep working, with prizes waiting for them upon completion
of major milestones. One student even stayed up until 2 am this morning to keep
working!

Students were inspired by the wonderful speakers who came throughout the week.
Here are a few takeaways from the lunchtime speakers:

[freeCodeCamp\'s (New) Responsive Web Design Course]: https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/
[Comunidad]: https://www.comunidadva.org

- Rebecca and Patrick of Comunidad kicked us off on Monday, and shared their
  experiences in the tech industry. Rebecca learned web design over lockdown and
  Patrick studied computer science in college and will be teaching CS at Gonzaga
  College High School this fall.
- Chris impressed upon us that "character counts" (pun intended?) and led
  everyone through an example where he used Python web scraping to solve a real
  life need. (I'll be using what I learned from him to build a tool for students
  to compare their progress with each other this summer.)
- Aidan, Ms. Maralee's nephew, shared from the heart, making sure students
  understood that it was ok and normal to struggle at times. He emphasized the
  importance of perseverance and also provided practical college and career
  advice.
- Dani, Jordi, Josie, Julia, and Tomi, came from MasterCard and seem to have
  found a great work-life balance. We learned that internships during college
  can really prepare you well for future employment.
- Albert, Ian, Katie came from [Brazen] to share about jobs in information
  technology and security. We also learned that a college degree isn't always
  necessary to find a job in the IT field, since certificates can vouch for your
  competency.

Ricardo did an amazing job introducing speakers throughout the week and leading
the panel today!

This week was a huge win for everyone involved! We will provide an update later
in August when the program comes to an end. Thank you for believing in Willston
Web.
